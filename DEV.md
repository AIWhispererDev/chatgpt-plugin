expose api and plugin info through api
work on plugin info and on small openapi definition
deploy on normal url
add handling of binary files (right now the read/write is handling utf-8 data)
add prettier
finish readme - setup
finish GCP deployment
add vale
review tsconfig

insight - we can change the api for the plugin whenever so we don't need to think about backward compatibility too much
-> it is understood everytime again
